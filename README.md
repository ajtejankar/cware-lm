### Design choices

1. Use Frank's or the github dataset?
2. Add start of word and end of word characters to the vocabulary (that makes it 50 char vocab size)
3. What's 51st character? Is it unknown character? But, that doesn't have any meaning. Perhaps, padding character?
4. Treat '\<UNK\>' with individual characters?
